        alert("Welcome to the game where I (the computer) will guess the number you are thinking of. I will first need a range")

            // 4) Display an alert to let the user know the game is starting.
        alert("The game is starting beep boop beep")

            // 5) Have the computer guess the middle number in the current range.

            // 6) Prompt the user to see if the guess is correct. The user should respond with:
            userResponse = prompt(`The computer guessed the number ${guess} Is that correct? Enter c for correct, h for too high, and l for too low`).toLowerCase();
            //Increment guesses:
            numGuesses++;


            
            // 7) Based on the user’s response, adjust the range accordingly:
            if(userResponse === "h"){
                maxNum = guess;
            }else if(userResponse === "l"){
                minNum = guess;
            }else if(userResponse === "c"){
                minNum = guess;
                maxNum = guess;
            }else{
                alert("Not a valid response")
            }
        }while(userResponse!="c")

        // 9) Once the computer guesses the number, display the number of attempts it took.
        alert(`Hooray! The computer geuss it! It only took ${numGuesses} tries`)
